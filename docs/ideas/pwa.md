## PWA or Progressive Web App
This feature idea is meant to reduce the amount of development required for this application. This allows for us to deploy our Web App to iOS and Android without two different native applications for the same project.

## Basic Idea
Build a web application and then make a PWA to allow for the application to be seamless between browser and mobile devices. It will also increase performance metrics (account to brainhub and softr). Once this application has been built out and tested it, we can then decide if we must make native applications or not.
